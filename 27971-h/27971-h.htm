W. J. Loftie, B.A., F.S.A., Author of "A History of
London," &amp;c., &amp;c. Illustrated by W. Luker, Jun.,

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Since the publication of Faulkner's work in 1820, no history of Kensington
pretending to accuracy or completeness has been produced.
This work contains full and descriptive accounts of the parish
of Kensington and the adjoining Palace and Gardens, with the
changes and improvements of the past half century or more; notices
of Kensington celebrities and of the great national institutions
which have sprung up at Kensington Gore and Brompton Park;
and a fund of discursive matter of local and historical interest.
The engravings include artistic exteriors and interiors; glimpses
of Kensington Gardens; the Palace in which the Queen was born;
the park; the people, streets, houses, churches, and ruins; and
pretty, quaint, and taking "bits" of Kensington scenery. All the
drawings have been engraved in Paris in the finest possible manner,
and the paper on which they are printed has been specially manufactured
of a quality to ensure the delicacy of the originals being
fully retained.</p>

<p>For the curious a few PROOF copies of KENSINGTON: <span class="smcap">Picturesque
And Historical</span> at five guineas, bound in full morocco, have
painted in water-colours on the front, under the gilt edges of the
leaves, a couple of Kensington views, which until the leaves are
bent back at an angle, are invisible.</p></div>

AUTHOR'S PAPER PAD may be comfortably used, whether at the
desk, held in the hand, or resting on the knee. As being most
convenient for both author and compositor, the paper is ruled the
narrow way, and of course on one side only.&mdash;<i>Sixpence each, 5/- per
dozen, ruled or plain.</i></p>
